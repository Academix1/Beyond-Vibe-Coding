                "As one developer noted, 'This wave of vibe coding isn't inherently bad. It can spark interest in programming for people who wouldn't otherwise try it. It's like how HTML and CSS widgets fascinated many of us years ago and led us into web development.'",
                "However, there's a critical distinction between using AI to assist your coding and relying on it to build production software without understanding the underlying principles.",
                "When your project becomes complex, AI models go from writing good code to merely working code to eventually bad code that's neither functional nor maintainable."

                "The reality? AI coding tools are powerful, but without proper guardrails, they can become digital wrecking balls in your codebase."
